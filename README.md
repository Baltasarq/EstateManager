# EstateManager

A desktop real estate manager.

This is the port of a **C# v1.0**'s 2005 application. to a more modern (2018, as the time of writing this), **C#** (around 5.0, at least).

This application allows to browse real estates by their containing places, and generate an HTML cross-references set of pages that can be written to a CD or similar and have the database in a stand-alone version.

Written originally for *Visual Studio/Windows*, ported so it can be also executed on *Mono/Linux*.
